### Assignment 2 submission for the course Reinforcement Learning 2023/2024 at Leiden University

Contains all the code necessary to run a DQN ablation study on the CartPole-v1 gym environment, as well (theoretically) any other gym environment with a similar action/observation space configuration. 

#### Usage:

From the project directory, all of the figures shown in the report can be generated by running 

### `make_all_plots.sh`

which will then run all the experiments and save the figures in the `figures` directory. In addition, a table will be written to `results_table.txt`, containing the data for the ablation study results table shown in the report.

Individual experiments can be (re)run by running `run_experiment.py` with the appropriate flags, e.g.:

### `python3 run_experiment.py --no_target_network --no_experience_replay`

A more complete run-down of the possible parameters can be found by running

### `python3 run_experiment.py --help`
